# My Sway Dotfiles
Uhh.. Hi, this is my first repository and i'm learning that how do i use Github.

Software That I Use:

- **Artix-s6** (operating system which based on arch)
- **Sway** (Window Manager)
- **Thunar** (file manager)
- **Alacritty** (terminal)
- [Kanshi](https://github.com/emersion/kanshi) (It helps you to make resulotion settings)
- **Neofetch** (I don't want to explain neofetch. Probably you've already known what it is)
- **WayBar** (Its like polybar but it made for wayland)
- [Rofi](https://github.com/lbonn/rofi) (**lbonn's fork** because that fork supports wayland)
- **Firefox** (Browser) (Note for firefox: If you want execute firefox without xwayland watch this video from 4.20 to 5.30 https://youtu.be/hRIGYUWQfYU)
- **SDDM** (Display Manager)
- **yay** (Aur Helper)
- **xwayland** (some apps might not work with wayland. And this software is for that problem)
-  **zsh** (shell) (Note for zsh: I use zsh with oh my zsh and [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme)

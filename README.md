# My Sway Dotfiles
Uhh.. Hi, this is my first repository and i'm learning that how do i use Github.

Software That I Use:

- Sway (Window Manager)
- Thunar (file manager)
- Alacritty (terminal)
- Kanshi (It helps you to make resulotion settings)
- Neofetch (I don't want to explain neofetch. Probably you've already known what it is)
- WayBar (Its like polybar but it made for wayland)
- Rofi (lbonn's fork because that fork supports wayland)
- Firefox (Browser)
 
 - I'll Add photos about it when it's done. Bye 4 Now! (2022-01-07)

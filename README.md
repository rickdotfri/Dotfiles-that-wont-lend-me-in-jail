# My Sway Dotfiles
Uhh.. Hi, this is my first repository and i'm learning that how do i use Github.

Software That I Use:

- **Sway** (Window Manager)
- **Thunar** (file manager)
- **Alacritty** (terminal)
- **Kanshi** (It helps you to make resulotion settings)
- **Neofetch** (I don't want to explain neofetch. Probably you've already known what it is)
- **WayBar** (Its like polybar but it made for wayland)
- [Rofi](https://github.com/lbonn/rofi) (**lbonn's fork** because that fork supports wayland)
- **Firefox** (Browser)
- **SDDM** (Display Manager)
 
 ## Installation
  
  ### For Arch Based Systems:
   `sudo pacman -S sway sddm alacritty thunar firefox kanshi waybar` <br/>
   `yay -S rofi-lbonn-wayland-git`
